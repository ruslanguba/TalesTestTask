Unity Technical Test Submission

This repository contains my implementation of the provided Unity technical tasks.

The original assignment focused on:

- Refactoring UI and improving performance
- Implementing a reusable popup system
- Designing a safe entity tracking approach
- Demonstrating production-oriented thinking

After completing the requested tasks, I decided to integrate the implemented systems into a small mini-game prototype. 
The goal was to demonstrate how the individual technical solutions can work together within a coherent project structure, rather than existing as isolated examples.

The mini-game combines:

- Entity lifecycle tracking
- Event-driven UI updates
- Popup interactions with callbacks
- Task generation and validation logic

The intention was not to over-engineer the solution, but to show practical application, clean separation of concerns, and maintainable architecture in a realistic scenario.

A detailed README describing gameplay and structure can be found inside the project.
